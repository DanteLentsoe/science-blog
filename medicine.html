									<p>Blindness, loss of hearing, Sickle Cell anemia, and Down Syndrome. Those are a finite list some of the most 
										common genetically related illnesses. I am sure most reasonable human beings would opt for a genetic reboot to rectify those 
										genetic errors. Well, with the advent of CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats), using DNA sequence of 
										bacterium along with a protein called CAS9 (CRISPR ASsociated protein 9), this can be achieved.
                                        </p>

									<p>Genetic engineering has been with us for long, even before the discovery of microbes. Farmers would use selective breeding (artificial selection), in order to isolate genes best suited for their 
										production. The techonology was then accelerated in the 20th century. With techniques such as gene knock therapy, and more recently CRISPR. People summon scowls when they hear GMO's (Genetically Modified Organisms), 
										despite the fact that it has been with us since the dawn for argiculture. Advancements in CRISPR has proven itself to be effective, mice with genetic hearing loss could be aided, with mice having their hearing rejuvenated, and 
										for better or worse, He Jiankui conducted a study with limted ethical clearance, on two twin babies.

									</p>

									<p>He Jiankui used CRISPR to inhibit CCR5 gene with encodes protein that allows HIV to replicate itself, thus essentially modifying the twins genes to form resistance against HIV infection. He then earned himself a 3 year sentence in prison, 
										lost his job, and was fined $450 000. The 
										research proved that for better or worse, the techonology can be implemented now. Although, some ethical regulations and use 
										of the technology is yet to be determined for us moving forward. Due to Jiankui's efforts having some serious draw backs, such as enabling more compromised immune systems, given that CCR5 also aids in 
										compacting other illnesses such as West Nile virus (mosquito-borne disease).
                                        </p>

									<p>Conventions of treatment of illness, more particularly, genetic diseases proved to be feaisble, at least scientifically. The prospect of having 
										designer babies may prove to enhence the gap of poverty and literacy, as genetic markers for mental and physical performance have been identified. 
										And should private companies, choose to employ the technology, this might lead to drastic alterations in the status quo, of what it means to be 
										'normal'.
