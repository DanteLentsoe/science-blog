									<p>By simply looking at mutton (lamb meat), and beef (cattle meat), could you tell the difference between
										them, especially if they do not have labels? If you are a Meat Sciencist, Animal Sciencist, Farmer, and or careful shoper,
										probably. But for most of us, probably not.
                                        </p>

									<p>Given that consumption of meat is increasing proportionally to the growth of the population.
										This increases the need for agriculture (livestock production) practises to adapt to the demand, thus factors such as water,
										, land and environmental stress, are to be considered. Outside the problems associated with livestock production (limitations of natural resources),
                                        health concerns are evident in consumption of meat, leading to various forms of cancers, and cardiovascular diseases.
									</p>

									<p>Now, suggesting people to stop eating meat, and for animal cruelty (slaugthering animal, confinement of animals and large mass productions) to be brought to a halt, seems 
										unreasonable. So what can be done? Well it turns out, there are some alternatives to traditional methodlogies of producing meat. One of the 
										most championed research endeavours, is 3-D printing of meat. WHAT!!! AS IN AN ACTUAL PRINTER IN MY OFFICE? well not exactly. Well Start-Up companies like
										Redefine, have been experimenting with the technology since 2006, to date, and they have made some substantial progress. 


                                        </p>

									<p>How, you might ask, does the alleged 3-D printing actually work? In a brief summary, artifically processed and dried ingredients (that meld at room temperature) 
										are stored in the machine. Then all the ingredients are then sent to the binder, which then according to the model provided (digital input/ information) deposit the powders (an example to think of is powered milk)
										to make a 3-D sample. Then the sample is further processed by heat treatment, in order to soften the materials. Although other materials such as gels (forms links between adjacent molecules),
										and cells (stem cells that are converted into myotubes) are used. I am not going to bother you with the details, as that is not our focal point. 
                                        </p>

									<p>Clearly there are some potential benefits to this practise. One is that environmental stress induced by pollution from animals i.e Cattle's Methane, competition for land and water will be reduced. 
										Moreover, deleterious components of meat (such as excess fat and iron) can be omitted in the printing process. Thus having tailored meat to an individuals health status. Other benefits is that no additional additives such as 
										antibiotics will be imposed into animals, thus eliminating that component to the end consumer.
                                            </p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<p>Although 3-D printing of meat is an exciting prospect, it is still within its infancy, and more research and investment will have to be delivered. The future prospects and implications
										are undeniable. We may have a new commerical standard that frees us from accient practises that date hundreds of thousands of years from our primodial ancestors, and usher in a new age of
										production, animal ethics and nutritional consciousness.
                                        </p>
