									<p>Some years ago a controvesial book titled 'Men Who Rape' which was published by Springer, and
										written by  A. Nicholas Groth in 1979.
										In Nicholas's account of the sexual misconduct bestowed upon society, took a
									was centralized look at individuals pyschology, but with time as we have come to see,
								many more factors contribute to this taboo. Interesting enough, it is not limited to people.
                                        </p>

									<p>It turns out many species replicate this taboo behavior, although in other animals
										with the exception of humans, it is more causually called Sexual coercion. The act remains 
									the same, with regard to sexual violence, harassment, intended to induce forced reproduction, or otherwise pleasure of the offender
								at the expense of the victim. </p>

									<p>This has been documented as an evolutionary adaption of species, in that females 
										 have limitations (Biological) to the amount of offspring they can nature and produce.
										This leads to a limitation in avaliable mates for reproducing with males, as such more aggressive, and enforced 
										behaviours allows animals (the males) to succeed their genetic "information", to successive generations.
										 This is observed in 
										aquatic species (such as so called cute dolphins), and terristial species (insects, humans, lions, and more).
                                        </p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<p>A study published in 2015, in the International 
										Journal of Epidemiology, asserted that genetic factors of animals contribute
										to approximately 40% of rape. Although no specific gene markers were used in the study, and 
										it only took into account a sample size of convicted sex offenders. Moreover, isolating 
										cause and effect with subject matters such as rape are not that cut and dry.
                                        </p>

									<p> So, what does this entail? Well for one, so called "aggressive" genes in mammals
										located on the Y- Chromosome such as DBA/1 and C57BL/10 (which are male specific),
										may be the causation of aggressive sexual behavior, as the genes have correlated effects
										on output of testosterone hormane (hormone, for sexual characteristics and overall biological aggression).
                                            </p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<p>So does this mean we cannot regulate our actions, and that male species are doomed to practise unethical means of reproduction
										outside their free will? Well No. Female chimps have been found to take part in the act, although the reasons are unclear.
										In the case of human beings, the matter is of a complex one, given that we can regulate some degree of our thoughts thanks to the presence of 
										our frontal cortex. We can take actions at our free will. However, some people with less developed frontal 
										lopes, tend to be more impulsive, and thus a collective of these factors increases the probability of an individual commiting the act.

									<p>In conclusion, yes unethical acts such as sexual assualt, have a strong correlation with nature (genetics, although not all). This does not mitigate the harmful,
										long lasting effects it delivers. In wild animals, very little can be done to bring it to a hault, yet for human beings
										the narrative is different, we can author a new school of thought powered by proper support structures and treatments, to remedy our society and 
										free ourselves from apparent "uncontrolable instincts".
                                        </p>
